h2. Warnings

This software has NOT BEEN TESTED :(
Use it at your own risk.
Please beware that it may not work on all versions of Redmine (it's working fine with my installation of 1.2-stable)

Redsync assumes that your local timezone is the same as your Redmine timezone.
Sign in and go to "My Account" to change it.

Redsync does not deal with edit conflicts well.
In fact, it does not deal with conflics AT ALL.
A default run of redsync will downsync first, overwriting any local changes if pages are updated on Redmine.
Then it will upsync any remaining changes.
